# RSC Sprite Baker

RSC Sprite Baker is a standalone tool for rendering cache-backed 3D NPC
models and their animations into consistently aligned RuneScape
Classic-style sprite sheets.

The intended first input is the local 2009scape cache. The intended first
output is a transparent six-column by three-row PNG sheet containing front,
diagonal, side, diagonal-away, away, and combat views.

## Project boundaries

- This repository contains the baker, its tests, documentation, and neutral
  test fixtures only.
- RuneScape caches, extracted models, textures, rendered derivative assets,
  credentials, and absolute machine configuration do not belong in Git.
- Spoiled Milk may consume reviewed exported sprites, but its source and this
  repository have separate Git histories.
- The Core manager coordinates this project, while implementation happens in
  the dedicated `rsc-sprite-baker-ai-1` worker.

## Current status

Phase 1 now has a narrow compatibility proof for one untextured revision-530
NPC model. See [`docs/COMPATIBILITY_SPIKE.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY_SPIKE.md) for
the reproducible evidence and [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the
ordered implementation plan.

## Compatibility-spike CLI

JDK 11 or newer and Maven are required. The command refuses to write into the
cache and, when run from this checkout, into the repository:

```bash
mvn test
mvn exec:java \
  -Dexec.args="--cache /path/to/user-supplied/cache \
  --output-dir /tmp/rsc-sprite-baker-output --npc 72"
```

The output is one transparent diagnostic PNG and one JSON manifest. Textures,
animation transforms, UI, sprite sheets, and batch processing are intentionally
outside this spike.

## Local collaboration

The manager checkout is `/home/justin/rsc-sprite-baker`. The exclusive worker
checkout is `/home/justin/rsc-sprite-baker-ai-1`.

```bash
./scripts/ai-manager.sh status
./scripts/ai-workspace.sh start ai-1 feat/cache-compatibility-spike
```

The small wrappers reuse the hardened collaboration implementation owned by
the sibling Core repository. Product source remains independent; only local
workspace orchestration is shared.
